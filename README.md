OOP in Python with a card game



This is a little challenge, my first in Python, of codung a card game with Python OOP
It was given to us by our coach Tom in becode coding school!



This project was given to test our ability to use Python, I assume, and also to let us learn to struggle ourself,
to go beyond our limits and to have a lot on where we should go these next months of learning.



The project is given on november, it is our first project for our promo the "Thomas"



I made it with Python OOP. I also use git and Github to manage it.


Let me introduce myself now, I'm Ousmane DIOP a Junior AI Developper at BeCode.org Liege (belgium)



Hope you will find it usefull, don't hesitate to give a feedback for improvement!!!
